      <p>Hello! My name is Christian Patino, I'm from Otavalo Ecuador. I have lived in Ecuador for many years, recently I got marry and we decided to move to Washington, D.C. with my wife </p>
      <p>I studied architecture in my country, I liked it very much, but I also had a passion for technology and computers. My wife and I decided to pursue the same career in technology. </p>
      <p>One of the things I enjoy the most is learning, sometimes it's very hard, but with persistence, I will reach my goals. I don't have much free time but I love to play soccer. I used to be very good, but now, not that much. I also like to play chess. Finally, my family, I have two brothers, I'm the one in the middle. </p>
